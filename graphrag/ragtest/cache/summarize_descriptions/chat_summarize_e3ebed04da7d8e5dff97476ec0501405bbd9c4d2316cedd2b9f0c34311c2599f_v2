It is marked by family gatherings, feasting, and gift-giving, and is a time when communities come together in cheer and support for one another, particularly emphasizing charity and kindness towards the needy. In the narrative, Christmas serves as a crucial backdrop for the character of Scrooge, who initially dismisses the holiday as a 'humbug.' However, throughout the story, Christmas symbolizes the potential for personal transformation, as Scrooge undergoes a significant change in character during this season.\n\nThe holiday is depicted as a time filled with strong emotions, evoking reflections on the past and the importance of family and togetherness. It is celebrated with various traditions, including games, music, and merry songs, which highlight the warmth and reconciliation associated with the season.
