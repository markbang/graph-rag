Initially, Scrooge exhibits a deep disdain for the Christmas season, openly expressing his negativity by dismissing it as a \"humbug\" and rejecting its messages of goodwill and the spirit of generosity. His initial views reflect a resistance to the joy, laughter, and familial connections that Christmas embodies.\n\nThroughout the story, Christmas serves as the backdrop for Scrooge's emotional awakening and realization of his values. The holiday symbolizes his journey, highlighting essential themes such as redemption, generosity, and the spirit of giving. As the narrative unfolds, Scrooge learns to embrace the spirit of Christmas, which signifies his personal transformation and represents the emotional ties he has to the holiday and its significance.\n\nUltimately, Scrooge's character arc illustrates a profound change in attitude towards Christmas, underscoring a central relationship between himself and the holiday he initially despised.
