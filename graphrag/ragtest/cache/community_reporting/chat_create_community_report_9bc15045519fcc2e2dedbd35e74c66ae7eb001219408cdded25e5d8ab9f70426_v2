He is portrayed as a stingy and unfeeling man, embodying the essence of greed and its far-reaching consequences, especially during the Christmas season. Scrooge's life takes a pivotal turn when he is haunted by the ghost of his deceased friend, Jacob Marley, who warns him to expect visitations from three spirits.\n\nThroughout the narrative, Scrooge reflects on his past, experiencing profound remorse and nostalgia. The visitations from the Ghost of Christmas Past allow him to revisit key moments from his life, such as his interactions with his erstwhile employer, Mr. Fezziwig, and his relationships with family, including his nephew and younger sister, Fan. This journey incites transformation within him as he confronts the consequences of his avarice.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Scrooge's cold demeanor and disdain for Christmas are challenged by the insights he gains from the spirits. The Ghost of Christmas Present reveals to him the joys and warmth of the holiday, prompting him to reconsider his attitude toward generosity and compassion. By the time he encounters the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, Scrooge is compelled to confront the stark outcomes of his miserly life, leading him to vow for change.\n\nUltimately, Scrooge transforms from a grumpy, dismissive old man into a figure of kindness and generosity, demonstrated when he raises Bob Cratchit’s salary and embraces the spirit of Christmas.
